Similar to the [CPU rating page](https://github.com/miptleha/cpu-rating), I look at the ratings of all mobile processors (single-thread, multi-thread) on [Notebook Check Site](https://www.notebookcheck.com/Smartphone-Prozessoren-Benchmarkliste.149507.0.html), as well as the [integrated GPU's performance](https://www.notebookcheck.com/Smartphone-Grafikkarten-Benchmarkliste.149357.0.html).  
Altenative Antutu [rating](https://www.antutu.com/en/ranking/soc0.htm).  
Next, I look at the [List of Current Sales](https://www.nix.ru/price/price_list.html?section=smartphones_mobile_phones_all#c_id=368&fn=368&g_id=265&new_goods=0&page=all&sort=%2Bp6510%2B5528%2B5529&spoiler=1&store=msk-0_1721_1&thumbnail_view=2) and generate an HTML page with a comparative rating of current processors (phones available for purchase in Russia).  
Unfortunately, many phone manufacturers (as well as laptop manufacturers) equip their devices with older components to reduce device price. In addition to the RAM and storage size, as well as screen resolution, which are obvious to every user, there is another important component: **THE PROCESSOR**.
